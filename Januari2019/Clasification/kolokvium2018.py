"""
Потребно е да се направи систем кој ќе знае да класифицира твитови во однос на тонот
(sentiment) на позитивен и негативен. Дадена ви е листа train_data од торки.
Прв елемент во торката е класата (positive/negative) и втор елемент е содржината на твитот.
Користејќи ги првите 200 примери, да се изгради наивен Баесов класификатор кој ќе
научи да класифицира непознати твитови. Потоа, со една употреба на наредбата input(), без
употреба на специјани парсирања, треба да се прочита влезот кој е торка со два елементи -
првиот е непознат текст кој треба да се класифицира со научениот класификатор и
вториот елемент е неговата вистинска класа.

Во првата линија се печати точната класа, предвидената класа и дали се тие еднакви. Пример:

('Tocno:' 'positive', 'Predvideno:', 'positive', 'Tocna klasifikacija:', True)

Дополнително, треба да се класифицираат последните 5 примери од тренинг множеството и да се
испечати нивната вистинска класа и нивната предвидена класа, во ист формат како и за прочитаниот влез.

Значи на крај треба да има испечатени вкупно 6 линии во идентичен формат.
